There are many different ways to represent a magnetic field. We derive here a representation of a general
magnetic field which is useful for two reasons. First, it displays manifestly the Hamiltonian character of the
magnetic field line trajectories. Secondly, it is the form which we will find most useful for discussing MHD
equilibrium and particle trajectories.

In this code the Poincare surfaces of sections are plotted, to study the formation of magnetic islands and the destruction of regular magnetic surfaces.
